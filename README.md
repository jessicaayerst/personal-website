# personal-website
Practice
These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

mkdir -p ~/workspace/foundations/exercises/personal-website && cd $_
touch index.html
In index.html, press shift + ! and you should see some boilerplate HTML.
Create a personal website to market yourself as a developer. Don't worry about coming up with all the text, just use a lorem ipsum generator. The web page should have:
A header element with the following child elements:
An <h1> element with your name
An <h2> element with your job title
An <aside> element with your bio:
An <h3> heading
A <p> element with your bio text
An <img> element with a picture of yourself
A <section> element for the techologies you'll know at the end of this program. It should contain:
An <h3> heading
A bulleted list of at least three languages. (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are fine for now.)
A <section> element about your work experience. It should contain:
An <h3> heading
An <article> element for each major point in your work history
A <footer> element with the text "Built by [your name]"
Your website will look pretty bad right now, but that's okay! CSS is up next.
